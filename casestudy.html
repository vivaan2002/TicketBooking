        <h4>Introduction: -</h4>
        <p>
            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript
            code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running 
            scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js 
            represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than 
            different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this 
            context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design 
            choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time 
            Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS 
            Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program 
        </p>

        <h4>Overview: -</h4>
        <p>
            Node.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of "modules" that handle various 
            core functionalities. Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL, or UDP), binary data (buffers), 
            cryptography functions, data streams, and other core functions. Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of 
            writing server applications. 
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available. As a result, Node.js 
            applications can be written in CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as Web servers. The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is 
            that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions 
            are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently or even in parallel, and use callbacks to signal completion or failure). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Node.js is officially supported on Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later), with tier 2 support for 
            SmartOS and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions available for IBM i (AS/400). The 
            provided source code may also be built on similar operating systems to those officially supported or be modified by third parties 
            to support others such as NonStop OS and Unix servers.

        <h4>Features of Node.js: -</h4>
        <p>
            Following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first choice of software architects.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Asynchronous and Event Driven −</h5>All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means 
                a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a 
                notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Very Fast − </h5>Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − </h5>Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps 
                the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create 
                limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much 
                larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>No Buffering − </h5>Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>License − </h5>Node.js is released under the MIT license
            </li>
        </ul>
